                Angele Henry strives to keep this site bug-free and up to date, but sometimes a little
                glitch can sneak into the code. If any info seems incorrect or if you encounter an
                unexpected problem, feel free to report it to angele.henry[at]ladyraccoon.com. I‚Äôll make
                sure to fix it üõ†Ô∏è.

            <h2>Governing Law</h2>
            <p>
                Just like the legal notice, this part of the game is governed by French law. In case of a
                dispute, the battle will take place in the French courts, like a good old legal quest ‚öîÔ∏è.
