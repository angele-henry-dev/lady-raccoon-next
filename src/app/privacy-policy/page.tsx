        Welcome to Lady Raccoon‚Äôs trust zone! Here, your data‚Äôs privacy is protected as securely as

            <p>
                Your data is valuable, and I treat it with the respect it deserves, like a legendary sword
                in an RPG.
            </p>
            <p>I only use it to:</p>
            <ul className="highlightList">

                <li>Improve the website and its performance (thank you, cookies!) üç™</li>

            <p>
                Rest assured, your info won‚Äôt be sold to dark lords or any other evil entities! Your data
                will never be shared without your consent, except if the law requires it (but let‚Äôs hope we
                never get there).
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Data Security</h2>
            <p>
                I take pride in securing your data as if it were guarded by a protective dragon. Technical
                and organizational measures are in place to prevent bad hackers from getting hold of it.

        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Your Rights</h2>
            <p>You have control over your data! It‚Äôs your ultimate power. You can:</p>
            <ul className="highlightList">
                <li>
                Request access to your data (to see what info I have on you, but I promise, nothing
                incriminating)
                </li>

                As mentioned in the legal notice, this site uses cookies. These are small files placed on
                your device to make navigation smoother and enhance the user experience. If you don‚Äôt like
